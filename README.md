# DNA Detective
Welcome to **DNA Detective**, a groundbreaking application designed to bring the intricate world of DNA analysis to your fingertips. Created by a dedicated team of nine talented individuals, our mission is to empower users with the tools and knowledge to explore the secrets hidden within their genes.

## Overview
**DNA Detective** is a comprehensive tool that allows users to perform various DNA analyses, from validating DNA sequences to detecting mutations. The application is designed for anyone with an interest in genetics, whether you're a student, researcher, or just curious about DNA.

## Key Features
1. **DNA Sequence Checker**
* Validates DNA sequence pairs to ensure correctness.
* Verifies that nucleotide pairs follow the rule of A pairing with T and G pairing with C.
* Confirms the presence of all pairs within the sequence.
2. **DNA Sequence Similarity Checker**
* Compares two DNA sequences and calculates their similarity as a percentage.
* Utilizes a Finite State Machine (FSM) with states such as Start, Match, Mismatch, and End.
* Helps users understand the degree of similarity between sequences.
4. **Protein Synthesis**
* Facilitates the process of protein synthesis through transcription and translation.
* Transcription converts DNA to mRNA, forming codons.
* Translation involves ribosomes reading mRNA to assemble proteins based on codon sequences.
* Each codon is paired with complementary anticodons on tRNA, carrying specific amino acids to form proteins.
5. **Mutation Detection**
* Compares two DNA sequences to detect differences or mutations.
* Identifies substitutions, insertions, or deletions of nucleotide bases at specific positions.
* Provides insights into genetic variations and potential impacts on protein synthesis.

## My Role in the Project
I had the opportunity to contribute to this exciting project by focusing on the Protein Synthesis functionality. Specifically, I:
* Wrote the code that handles the transcription and translation processes, ensuring accurate protein synthesis.
* Designed the **Protein Synthesis GUI**, creating an intuitive interface that guides users through the complex steps of protein formation.
